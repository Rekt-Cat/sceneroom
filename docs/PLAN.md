# Plan

## Current status

- **Phase:** 4 (lights, materials, environment), started: materials (roughness and metalness) are written on branch `feature/materials`, waiting for a browser check
- **Done:** Phases 0 to 3, all on `main` and live at https://sceneroom.vercel.app: 3D viewport; scene model; selection, multi-select, gizmo, camera controls; add / duplicate / delete / rename; scene list with search and drag-to-re-parent; Inspector (position, rotation, scale, colour, parent); undo/redo; resizable panels and value dragging; lock. A git pre-push hook runs type-check, lint, test and build before every push.
- **CI:** green on pull requests #2 to #4 (last merge `4461bb0`).
- **Next action:** push and merge `feature/materials`. Then model import (`ASSETS-AND-IMPORT.md` steps 1 and 2: import a GLB, Assets panel), then **Surface and shading**, then lights, then environment settings. Plans for later are in `ADVANCED-EDITING.md` and `ASSETS-AND-IMPORT.md`. Still open: test `SETUP-SECOND-PC.md` on the second PC; try the pre-push hook from GitHub Desktop; optional `/code-review` of the Phase 0-3 diffs.

Update this block at the end of every sub-phase and commit it.

## Goal

A browser-based, real-time collaborative 3D scene editor ("Figma for 3D"). MVP is a scene/environment editor with
multiplayer. Mesh modeling and sculpting come later (see `ADVANCED-EDITING.md`). Everything runs on free hosting.

## Stack

TypeScript, Next.js (React), Tailwind, Three.js with React Three Fiber, Zustand, Zod, Yjs with a Hocuspocus
WebSocket server (Node), PostgreSQL with Prisma, Docker, GitHub Actions, Vitest, Playwright, Cloudflare R2 (S3 API).
Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo. See `WHAT-WE-USED.md` for installed versions and `DECISIONS.md` for reasons.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation

- [x] Tools: Node 24 (fnm), pnpm via Corepack, git
- [x] GitHub repo, `.gitignore`, README
- [x] Monorepo with `apps/web` and `packages/shared`
- [x] `docs/WHAT-WE-USED.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] `docs/SETUP-SECOND-PC.md` verified on the second PC, `.env.example`
- [x] Prettier, GitHub Actions workflow (format check + lint + type-check + build); green on GitHub
- [x] First Claude Code hook (Prettier after edits) written and pipe-tested; firing still to confirm after `/hooks` reload
- [x] Skill to update WHAT-WE-USED.md (`/update-what-we-used`); loading still to confirm after `/reload-skills`
- [x] First diagram (repo, CI and Claude Code setup): `docs/diagrams/dev-workflow.html`

### Phase 1: 3D viewport

- [x] Three.js + React Three Fiber + drei; canvas, grid, lights, cube, orbit controls, FPS overlay (confirmed in a browser; drag feel tuned)
- [x] `docs/TUNING.md`: settings the owner can adjust
- [x] Deploy the early version to Vercel: https://sceneroom.vercel.app (HTTP 200, served by Vercel)
- [x] Architecture diagram (built parts solid, planned parts dashed): `docs/diagrams/architecture.html`
- [ ] Optional: `/code-review` pass on the Phase 0-1 diffs

### Phase 2: Scene model and editing tools

- [x] Scene schema in `packages/shared` (types + Zod)
- [x] Pure scene operations (add, remove, duplicate, update, transform) with Vitest tests; Zustand store; render nodes from the store
- [x] Click to select (raycasting) with outline; multi-select (Shift + click, Ctrl/Cmd + drag box) with a group gizmo
- [x] Transform gizmo (move/rotate/scale) and snapping
- [x] Add (cube, sphere, cylinder, plane, cone), delete, duplicate, rename

### Phase 3: Editor panels and undo/redo

- [ ] Layout: toolbar, Hierarchy, Inspector, Viewport (shadcn/ui)
- [x] Hierarchy tree with visibility, search, Add menu, docked panels and tool dock (branch `feature/hierarchy`)
- [x] Inspector fields: position, rotation, scale, colour (branch `feature/inspector`); material values later
- [x] Lock objects: padlock in the scene list and Inspector, key `L`; a locked object cannot be edited (branch `feature/lock`, needs a browser check)
- [x] Re-parenting: drag rows in the scene list or use the Parent list in the Inspector; children are drawn inside their parents (branch `feature/reparenting`, needs a browser check)
- [x] Resizable side panels (drag the edge) and Unity-style dragging of X / Y / Z values (branch `feature/panels-scrub`)
- [x] Undo/redo (snapshot history, buttons and Ctrl/Cmd + Z) with Vitest tests for the store (branch `feature/undo-redo`)

### Phase 4: Lights, materials, environment

- [x] Materials: roughness and metalness per object, sliders in the Inspector (branch `feature/materials`, committed; waiting for the pull request)
- [ ] **Surface and shading** (after model import, before lights): move the material values into a `material` section of the scene data (so later shared materials and material slots fit); add Emissive (colour and strength), Opacity (solid / see-through / cut-out), Double-sided, Smooth or flat shading (with an angle limit), Cast and Receive shadow switches, Reflection strength. Each with its own reset button, a default in `TUNING.md` and tests
- [ ] Point/spot/directional lights; HDRI sky and an environment for reflections; shadows, fog; camera nodes
- [ ] Later, once the asset system exists: texture maps (base colour, normal, roughness, metalness, occlusion, height, emissive) with tiling, material presets, shared materials. Advanced surfaces (clearcoat, transmission, sheen, subsurface, anisotropy, iridescence) and material slots: see `ADVANCED-EDITING.md`, section F

### Phase 5: Import/export and local save

- [ ] **Import models** (premade cars, buildings, characters): GLB first, drag-and-drop and an Import button; a "model" object kind that points to an asset id; size and triangle limits with clear error messages (see `ASSETS-AND-IMPORT.md`; steps 1 and 2 there can be built right after materials, before the rest of this phase)
- [ ] Assets panel: thumbnails, place copies, rename, delete, source and licence note
- [ ] glTF export; scene JSON with schema version; autosave (IndexedDB); validation; glTF with separate files, compressed models, then OBJ
- [ ] Design the editable-mesh data format and where big meshes are stored (see `ADVANCED-EDITING.md`, "The foundation"), so custom meshes can be saved and exported

### Phase 6: Docker, database, project backend

- [ ] docker-compose with Postgres; Prisma schema (User, Project, ProjectMember, Asset); API routes with Zod; seed script

### Phase 7: Real-time collaboration

- [ ] Yjs document as the source of truth; `apps/collab-server` (Hocuspocus, Dockerfile); persistence to Postgres
- [ ] Presence (names, colors, live 3D cursors, selections); per-user undo/redo
- [ ] Token check on connect, read-only enforcement, message size limit; test two windows, two devices, offline and reconnect

### Phase 8: Accounts, sharing, uploads

- [ ] Login (OAuth) and route protection; dashboard; share links with roles; R2 uploads via presigned URLs

### Phase 9: Testing, CI/CD, deployment

- [ ] Playwright test with two browser contexts; more unit tests; CI builds Docker image
- [ ] Deploy web (Vercel), collab server, database (Neon), files (R2); performance and security pass; monitoring

### Phase 10: Polish and extras

- [ ] README with demo GIF and live link; docs completed; extras (comments, version history)

### Phase 11: Deformers (can move earlier, right after Phase 5)

- [ ] Segment counts on primitives; modifier stack in the Inspector: Bend, Twist, Taper, Stretch, Noise, Mirror, Array, Subdivide; Apply (bake into a mesh)

### Phase 12: Environment-building tools

- [ ] Boolean (union / subtract / intersect); scatter / instancing; terrain (heightmap); splines / tubes; align, distribute, snapping; groups and prefabs

### Phase 13: Edit mode (modelling)

- [ ] Editable meshes; point / edge / face selection; extrude, inset, bevel, loop cut, knife, merge, bridge; soft selection; mirror editing; basic UVs; difference-based undo

### Phase 14: Sculpting

- [ ] Brushes (draw, smooth, grab, inflate, pinch, flatten, crease, mask); symmetry; remesh or dynamic topology; vertex-colour painting; BVH picking and Web Workers; per-stroke undo

### Phase 15: Characters and creatures

- [ ] Base meshes; skeleton and weights (auto-weights, painting); posing and IK; morph targets; reference images; character export (GLB with skeleton)

## Milestones

- **A** after Phase 3: polished single-user 3D editor, live since Phase 1.
- **B** after Phase 7: real-time multiplayer works.
- **C** after Phase 9: accounts, sharing, tests, CI/CD, stable deployment.
